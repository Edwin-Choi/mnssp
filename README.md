# Will be instructions on setting up the entire codebase
The project currently is comprised of:
Database: Dynamodb (to be finally confirmed, mongo is a possible solution too)
Backend: Python Flask-restplus (might migrate to a newer version as restplus isn't constantly updated)
Frontend: Javascript React-app + material-ui



Dynamodb (once set up on git)
going to have a few existing ids around for simplicity and testing
depending, if we want to have email authentication then we will use valid email but let's finish log in first before sign up (if we even are doing sign up)
